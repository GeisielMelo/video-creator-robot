# Video Creator Robot
I developed this robot last year, during the time when AI-narrated videos, without showing the face, were trending.

Its operation is quite simple. Add some questions, mark one as correct, send the request to the server, wait while the text is processed, and there you have it! A high-quality video, ready to be posted.

I used several tools in the development process, with the main ones being FFmpeg, ImageMagick, and the Elevenlabs API.

## Preview
